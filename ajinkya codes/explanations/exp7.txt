Okay, let's break down this C++ code for performing Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a graph representing cities and distances, using an adjacency matrix.

**Program Goal:**

The program builds a graph where vertices are cities (identified by airport codes) and edges represent connections with associated distances (stored in the adjacency matrix). It then performs and displays the results of a Depth-First Search (DFS) and a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from a user-specified initial city (vertex index).

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Graph:** A collection of vertices (cities) and edges (connections between cities).
*   **Undirected Graph:** An edge between city A and city B means you can travel in both directions. The adjacency matrix will be symmetric.
*   **Weighted Graph:** The edges have associated values (distances). In this code, the adjacency matrix stores distances, but for the purpose of BFS and DFS traversal, any non-zero value in `adj_mat[i][j]` simply indicates the presence of an edge. The actual distance isn't used in the traversal logic itself, only for building the graph.
*   **Adjacency Matrix:** A square matrix representation where `adj_mat[i][j]` stores the distance between vertex `i` and vertex `j`. `0` indicates no direct edge.
*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This implementation uses **recursion** (which implicitly uses the call stack).
*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores level by level. This implementation uses a standard library **queue**.
*   **Traversal:** Visiting each vertex in the graph.
*   **Visited Array/Set:** Used to track which vertices have already been visited to avoid infinite loops in graphs with cycles and to ensure each vertex is processed only once.

**Detailed Code Breakdown:**

1.  **Include Directives:**

    ```c++
    #include <iostream> // For input/output (cin, cout)
    #include <queue>    // For using the standard queue container
    #include <string>   // For using string objects (city names/codes)
    using namespace std;
    ```

    *   `#include <iostream>`: Provides standard input/output functionalities.
    *   `#include <queue>`: Provides the `std::queue` container, which is essential for the BFS implementation.
    *   `#include <string>`: Provides the `std::string` class for handling city names or airport codes.
    *   `using namespace std;`: Brings the standard namespace into scope.

2.  **Global Variables:**

    ```c++
    int adj_mat[50][50] = {0, 0}; // Adjacency matrix, initialized to 0s
    int visited[50] = {0};        // Visited array for DFS, initialized to 0s
    ```

    *   `int adj_mat[50][50] = {0, 0};`: Declares a 2D array `adj_mat` of size 50x50 to store the adjacency matrix. It's initialized with `{0, 0}`, which effectively initializes all elements to 0. This matrix will store the distances between cities. It has a fixed size, limiting the number of cities to 50.
    *   `int visited[50] = {0};`: Declares a 1D array `visited` of size 50. This array is used by the **DFS** function to keep track of visited vertices. It's initialized to all zeros (0 means not visited).

3.  **`dfs(int s, int n, string arr[])` Function:**

    ```c++
    void dfs(int s, int n, string arr[])
    {
        visited[s] = 1;         // Mark the current vertex 's' as visited
        cout << arr[s] << " ";  // Print the name of the current city

        // Explore neighbors
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            // Check if there is an edge between 's' and 'i' (adj_mat[s][i] is non-zero)
            // AND if vertex 'i' has not been visited yet (!visited[i])
            if (adj_mat[s][i] && !visited[i])
                dfs(i, n, arr); // Recursively call dfs on the unvisited neighbor
        }
    }
    ```

    *   This is a recursive implementation of Depth-First Search.
    *   `s`: The index of the current vertex (city) being visited.
    *   `n`: The total number of vertices (cities).
    *   `arr[]`: The array of city names (strings).
    *   `visited[s] = 1;`: Marks the current vertex `s` as visited by setting the corresponding element in the global `visited` array to 1.
    *   `cout << arr[s] << " ";`: Prints the name of the city corresponding to the current vertex index.
    *   `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`: This loop iterates through all possible vertices `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
    *   `if (adj_mat[s][i] && !visited[i])`: This is the core logic for finding the next vertex to visit:
        *   `adj_mat[s][i]`: Checks if there is a direct edge between vertex `s` and vertex `i`. Since `adj_mat` stores distances, any non-zero value indicates an edge.
        *   `!visited[i]`: Checks if vertex `i` has *not* been visited yet.
    *   `dfs(i, n, arr);`: If both conditions are true (there's an edge and the neighbor is unvisited), the `dfs` function is called recursively on the neighbor vertex `i`. This makes the DFS go "deep" along this path.
    *   The recursion naturally handles the backtracking when a branch is fully explored (i.e., when the loop finishes for a vertex, the function returns to the calling function, effectively backtracking).

5.  **`bfs(int s, int n, string arr[])` Function:**

    ```c++
    void bfs(int s, int n, string arr[])
    {
        bool visited[n]; // Local visited array for BFS
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            visited[i] = false; // Initialize local visited array to false

        int v;
        queue<int> bfsq; // Create a queue for BFS

        // Start BFS if the initial vertex hasn't been visited yet (important for disconnected graphs, though the main calls it only once)
        if (!visited[s])
        {
            cout << arr[s] << " "; // Print the starting vertex
            bfsq.push(s);          // Enqueue the starting vertex
            visited[s] = true;     // Mark the starting vertex as visited

            // Process the queue until it's empty
            while (!bfsq.empty())
            {
                v = bfsq.front(); // Get the vertex at the front of the queue
                // Explore neighbors of the current vertex 'v'
                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                {
                    // Check if there is an edge between 'v' and 'i'
                    // AND if vertex 'i' has not been visited yet
                    if (adj_mat[v][i] && !visited[i])
                    {
                        cout << arr[i] << " "; // Print the unvisited neighbor (visit it)
                        visited[i] = true;     // Mark the neighbor as visited
                        bfsq.push(i);          // Enqueue the neighbor
                    }
                }
                bfsq.pop(); // Dequeue the vertex 'v' after exploring its neighbors
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    *   This is an iterative implementation of Breadth-First Search using `std::queue`.
    *   `s`: The index of the starting vertex for this BFS component.
    *   `n`: The total number of vertices.
    *   `arr[]`: The array of city names.
    *   `bool visited[n];`: Declares a **local** boolean array `visited` inside the `bfs` function. This is important because BFS uses its own state tracking, independent of the global `visited` array used by DFS.
    *   `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) visited[i] = false;`: Initializes the local `visited` array to `false` (not visited).
    *   `queue<int> bfsq;`: Creates an empty queue of integers (vertex indices).
    *   `if (!visited[s])`: This check is included. In the `main` function, `bfs` is only called once for the initial vertex `u`, so this `if` is effectively just checking if `visited[u]` is false initially (which it will be). This check is useful if you were calling `bfs` repeatedly to traverse a disconnected graph.
    *   `cout << arr[s] << " ";`: Prints the starting city name.
    *   `bfsq.push(s);`: Enqueues the starting vertex.
    *   `visited[s] = true;`: Mark
