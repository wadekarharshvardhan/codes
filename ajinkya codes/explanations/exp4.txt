Okay, let's break down this C++ code in detail. This program focuses on building and traversing an **Expression Tree** from a **prefix expression**.

**Program Goal:**

The program takes a prefix mathematical expression (like `+*AB/CD`) as input, constructs a binary tree representing that expression, performs a non-recursive post-order traversal to display the postfix equivalent, and then deallocates the memory used by the tree.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Expression Tree:** A binary tree where:
    *   Leaf nodes are operands (variables or numbers).
    *   Internal nodes are operators (+, -, \*, /).
    *   The tree structure represents the order of operations.
*   **Prefix Expression:** An expression where the operator comes *before* its operands (e.g., `+ A B`).
*   **Infix Expression:** The standard way we write expressions, with operators between operands (e.g., `A + B`).
*   **Postfix Expression:** An expression where the operator comes *after* its operands (e.g., `A B +`).
*   **Binary Tree:** A tree where each node has at most two children (left and right).
*   **Stack:** A Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure, crucial for building the tree from prefix/postfix and for non-recursive traversals.
*   **Tree Traversal:** Visiting each node in a tree in a specific order (e.g., In-order, Pre-order, Post-order).
*   **Non-Recursive Traversal:** Performing a traversal without using recursive function calls, typically achieved using stacks.

**Detailed Code Breakdown:**

1.  **Include Directives:**

    ```c++
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string.h> // For strlen
    #include <cctype>   // For isalpha
    #include <cstdlib>  // For free and exit (though exit is unused in main)
    using namespace std;
    ```

    *   `#include <iostream>`: Standard input/output stream library (`cout`, `cin`).
    *   `#include <string.h>`: Includes functions for working with C-style strings, specifically `strlen` in this code.
    *   `#include <cctype>`: Includes functions for character testing, specifically `isalpha` to check if a character is an alphabet letter (operand).
    *   `#include <cstdlib>`: Includes general utility functions, including `free` (used for memory deallocation) and `exit` (declared but not used in the main execution path).
    *   `using namespace std;`: Brings the standard namespace into scope.

2.  **Node Structure:**

    ```c++
    struct node
    {
        char data;       // Stores the character (operand or operator)
        node *left;      // Pointer to the left child node
        node *right;     // Pointer to the right child node
    };
    ```

    *   `struct node`: Defines the structure for a node in the binary tree.
    *   `char data;`: This member stores the character data for the node. In an expression tree, this will be either an operand (like 'A', 'B', '5') or an operator (like '+', '-', '\*', '/').
    *   `node *left;`: A pointer to a `node` structure. This pointer will point to the root of the left subtree of the current node.
    *   `node *right;`: A pointer to a `node` structure. This pointer will point to the root of the right subtree of the current node.

3.  **Tree Class:**

    ```c++
    class tree
    {
        char prefix[20]; // Member to store the prefix expression (unused in the current implementation)

    public:
        node *top; // Pointer to the root of the expression tree
        void expression(char[]); // Function to build the tree from a prefix expression
        void display(node *); // Recursive function for pre-order traversal (unused in main)
        void non_rec_postorder(node *); // Non-recursive function for post-order traversal
        void del(node *); // Recursive function to delete the tree
    };
    ```

    *   `class tree`: Defines a class named `tree` to encapsulate the operations related to the expression tree.
    *   `char prefix[20];`: A member variable to potentially store the input prefix expression. However, it's not used in the current `expression` function, which takes the prefix string as an argument.
    *   `public:`: Members declared here are accessible from outside the class.
    *   `node *top;`: A public pointer named `top`. This pointer is intended to point to the root node of the expression tree. It's named `top` probably because it's the "top" of the tree, but `root` would be a more conventional name.
    *   `void expression(char[]);`: Prototype for the function that builds the expression tree from a given prefix expression (passed as a C-style character array).
    *   `void display(node *);`: Prototype for a recursive function to display the tree. Based on the order of printing `data`, `left`, then `right`, this is a **pre-order traversal**. Note that this function is defined but commented out in `main`.
    *   `void non_rec_postorder(node *);`: Prototype for a non-recursive function to perform a post-order traversal and display the nodes.
    *   `void del(node *);`: Prototype for a recursive function to delete all nodes in the tree to free up memory.

4.  **Stack Class:**

    ```c++
    class stack1
    {
        node *data[30]; // Array to store node pointers
        int top;        // Index of the top element in the stack

    public:
        stack1() // Constructor
        {
            top = -1; // Initialize top to -1 (empty stack)
        }
        int empty() // Check if the stack is empty
        {
            if (top == -1)
                return 1; // Return 1 (true) if empty
            return 0;     // Return 0 (false) if not empty
        }
        void push(node *p) // Push a node pointer onto the stack
        {
            data[++top] = p; // Increment top, then store the pointer
        }
        node *pop() // Pop a node pointer from the stack
        {
            return (data[top--]); // Return the pointer at top, then decrement top
        }
    };
    ```

    *   `class stack1`: Defines a class for a stack. This stack is specifically designed to hold pointers to `node` structures (`node*`).
    *   `node *data[30];`: An array to store the elements of the stack. It can hold up to 30 `node` pointers. This is a fixed-size stack.
    *   `int top;`: An integer member to keep track of the index of the top element in the `data` array. An empty stack is typically represented by `top = -1`.
    *   `stack1()`: The constructor. Initializes `top` to `-1` when a `stack1` object is created.
    *   `int empty()`: Returns `1` (true) if the stack is empty (`top == -1`), and `0` (false) otherwise.
    *   `void push(node *p)`: Adds a `node` pointer `p` to the top of the stack. It increments `top` *before* storing the pointer.
    *   `node *pop()`: Removes and returns the `node` pointer from the top of the stack. It returns the pointer at the current `top` index and then decrements `top`.

5.  **`tree::expression()` Function Implementation:**

    ```c++
    void tree::expression(char prefix[])
    {
        char c; // Unused variable
        stack1 s; // Create a stack object
        node *t1, *t2; // Pointers for temporary node storage
        int len, i; // Variables for length and loop counter

        len = strlen(prefix); // Get the length of the prefix expression
        for (i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--) // Iterate through the prefix expression from right to left
        {
            top = new node; // Create a new node for the current character
            top->left = NULL; // Initialize left child to NULL
            top->right = NULL; // Initialize right child to NULL

            if (isalpha(prefix[i])) // If the current character is an operand (alphabet letter)
            {
                top->data = prefix[i]; // Store the operand in the node's data
                s.push(top); // Push the operand node onto the stack
            }
            else if (prefix[i] == '+' || prefix[i] == '*' || prefix[i] == '-' || prefix[i] == '/') // If the current character is an operator
            {
                t2 = s.pop(); // Pop the first operand (which will be the right child in prefix)
                t1 = s.pop(); // Pop the second operand (which will be the left child in prefix)

                top->data = prefix[i]; // Store the operator in the node's data
                top->left = t2; // Make the first popped node the left child
                top->right = t1; // Make the second popped node the right child

                s.push(top); // Push the new operator node onto the stack
            }
        }
        top = s.pop(); // After processing all characters, the final node on the stack is the root of the tree
    }
    ```

    *   `void tree::expression(char prefix[])`: Definition of the `expression` function, which belongs to the `tree` class. It takes a C-style character array `prefix` as input.
    *   `stack1 s;`: Creates an instance of the `stack1` class. This stack will be used to temporarily store pointers to the subtrees being built.
    *   `node *t1, *t2;`: Declares two temporary `node` pointers.
    *   `len = strlen(prefix);`: Calculates the length of the input prefix string.
    *   **`for (i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--)`**: This loop iterates through the prefix expression **from right to left**. This is the standard approach for building an expression tree from a prefix expression using a stack.
    *   `top = new node;`: Inside the loop, a new `node` is created for the character being processed. The global `top` pointer is temporarily used to point to this newly created node.
    *   `top->left = NULL; top->right = NULL;`: The left and right child pointers of the new node are initialized to `NULL`.
    *   `if (isalpha(prefix[i]))`: Checks if the current character `prefix[i]` is an alphabet letter (using `isalpha` from `<cctype>`). If it is, it's considered an operand.
        *   `top->data = prefix[i];`: The operand character is stored in the `data` member of the new node.
        *   `s.push(top);`: The pointer to this operand node is pushed onto the stack.
    *   `else if (prefix[i] == '+' || ... || prefix[i] == '/')`: Checks if the current character is one of the supported operators.
        *   `t2 = s.pop();`: Pop the top element from the stack. When processing prefix from right to left, the first element popped is the *right* operand of the current operator.
        *   `t1 = s.pop();`: Pop the next element from the stack. This is the *left* operand.
        *   `top->data = prefix[i];`: The operator character is stored in the `data` member of the new node.
        *   `top->left = t2;`: The node popped first (`t2`, the right operand) becomes the *left* child of the operator node.
        *   `top->right = t1;`: The node popped second (`t1`, the left operand) becomes the *right* child of the operator node. This order is counter-intuitive but correct for building the tree from right-to-left prefix.
        *   `s.push(top);`: The pointer to the newly created operator node (with its children linked) is pushed back onto the stack. This node now represents a subtree rooted at this operator.
    *   `top = s.pop();`: After the loop finishes, the stack should contain only one node, which is the root of the entire expression tree. This pointer is popped and assigned to the global `top` (the class member `top`, which serves as the root of the tree).

6.  **`tree::display()` Function Implementation (Recursive Pre-order):**

    ```c++
    void tree::display(node *root)
    {
        if (root != NULL) // Check if the current node is not NULL
        {
            cout << root->data; // Visit the current node (print its data)
            display(root->left); // Recursively visit the left subtree
            display(root->right); // Recursively visit the right subtree
        }
    }
    ```

    *   `void tree::display(node *root)`: Definition of the recursive display function. It takes a `node` pointer `root` as input, representing the root of the subtree to display.
    *   `if (root != NULL)`: The base case for the recursion. If the current node is `NULL` (meaning we've gone past a leaf or encountered an empty subtree), the function simply returns, stopping the recursion in that branch.
    *   `cout << root->data;`: Prints the data of the current node.
    *   `display(root->left);`: Makes a recursive call to `display` for the left child.
    *   `display(root->right);`: Makes a recursive call to `display` for the right child.
    *   The order: Visit node -> Visit left -> Visit right is a **Pre-order Traversal**. For an expression tree, a pre-order traversal yields the **prefix expression**.

7.  **`tree::non_rec_postorder()` Function Implementation:**

    ```c++
    void tree::non_rec_postorder(node *top)
    {
        stack1 s1, s2; // Declare two stacks
        node *T = top; // Temporary pointer, starts at the root

        cout << "\n"; // Print a newline before the output

        s1.push(T); // Push the root node onto the first stack

        while (!s1.empty()) // While the first stack is not empty
        {
            T = s1.pop(); // Pop a node from s1
            s2.push(T); // Push the popped node onto the second stack

            if (T->left != NULL) // If the node has a left child
                s1.push(T->left); // Push the left child onto s1

            if (T->right != NULL) // If the node has a right child
                s1.push(T->right); // Push the right child onto s1
        }

        while (!s2.empty()) // While the second stack is not empty
        {
            top = s2.pop(); // Pop a node from s2
            cout << top->data; // Print the data of the popped node
        }
    }
    ```

    *   `void tree::non_rec_postorder(node *top)`: Definition of the non-recursive post-order traversal function. It takes the root of the tree (`top`) as input.
    *   `stack1 s1, s2;`: Creates two stack objects. This algorithm uses two stacks: `s1` for processing and `s2` for storing the nodes in the correct post-order sequence.
    *   `node *T = top;`: A temporary pointer `T` is initialized to the root.
    *   `s1.push(T);`: The root node is pushed onto the first stack (`s1`).
    *   **`while (!s1.empty())`**: The main loop continues as long as there are nodes to process in `s1`.
        *   `T = s1.pop();`: Pop a node from `s1`.
        *   `s2.push(T);`: Push the popped node onto `s2`. The key insight here is that by pushing nodes onto `s2` in this order (root, then right child, then left child), when we pop from `s2`, they will come out in post-order (left, right, root).
        *   `if (T->left != NULL) s1.push(T->left);`: If the popped node has a left child, push the left child onto `s1`.
        *   `if (T->right != NULL) s1.push(T->right);`: If the popped node has a right child, push the right child onto `s1`. Notice that the right child is pushed *after* the left child. Because `s1` is a LIFO stack, the right child will be popped *before* the left child in the next iteration of the outer loop.
    *   **`while (!s2.empty())`**: After the first loop finishes, `s2` contains all the nodes in a specific order. This loop pops nodes from `s2` and prints their data.
        *   `top = s2.pop();`: Pop a node from `s2`.
        *   `cout << top->data;`: Print the data of the popped node. Since nodes were pushed onto `s2` in (Current, Right, Left) order, popping from `s2` gives (Left, Right, Current) order, which is **Post-order**.

8.  **`tree::del()` Function Implementation (Recursive Deletion):**

    ```c++
    void tree::del(node *node)
    {
        if (node == NULL) // Base case: If the node is NULL, return
            return;

        /* first delete both subtrees */
        del(node->left); // Recursively delete the left subtree
        del(node->right); // Recursively delete the right subtree

        /* then delete the node */
        cout <<endl<<"Deleting node : " << node->data<<endl; // Optional: Print which node is being deleted
        free(node); // Deallocate the memory for the current node using free()
    }
    ```

    *   `void tree::del(node *node)`: Definition of the recursive deletion function. It takes a `node` pointer as input, representing the root of the subtree to delete. This function performs a **post-order traversal** for deletion.
    *   `if (node == NULL) return;`: The base case. If the current node is `NULL`, there's nothing to delete, so the function returns.
    *   `del(node->left);`: Recursively calls `del` on the left child. This ensures that the entire left subtree is deleted before processing the current node.
    *   `del(node->right);`: Recursively calls `del` on the right child. This ensures that the entire right subtree is deleted before processing the current node.
    *   `cout <<endl<<"Deleting node : " << node->data<<endl;`: This line is for demonstration, showing which node is being deleted. It's printed *after* deleting the left and right subtrees, confirming the post-order deletion logic.
    *   `free(node);`: This deallocates the memory pointed to by `node`. `free()` is the C-style memory deallocation function, which should be paired with `malloc()`, `calloc()`, or `realloc()`. Since the code uses `new` for allocation, the corresponding C++ deallocation operator `delete` would be more appropriate (`delete node;`). Using `free()` with memory allocated by `new` can lead to undefined behavior, although it might work in some compilers/situations.

9.  **`main()` Function:**

    ```c++
    int main()
    {
        char expr[20]; // Character array to hold the prefix expression
        tree t; // Create an object of the tree class

        cout <<"Enter prefix Expression : ";
        cin >> expr; // Read the prefix expression from the user

        cout << expr; // Print the entered prefix expression

        t.expression(expr); // Build the expression tree from the prefix expression

        // t.display(t.top); // Recursive pre-order display (commented out)
        // cout<<endl;

        t.non_rec_postorder(t.top); // Perform and display the non-recursive post-order traversal

        t.del(t.top); // Delete the entire tree starting from the root

        // t.display(t.top); // Attempting to display after deletion (will likely cause issues)
    }
    ```

    *   `int main()`: The entry point of the program.
    *   `char expr[20];`: Declares a C-style character array to store the prefix expression entered by the user. It can hold up to 19 characters plus a null terminator.
    *   `tree t;`: Creates an object named `t` of the `tree` class. When the object is created, the `tree` constructor (although not explicitly defined, the default constructor will initialize `top` to a garbage value unless explicitly initialized in the class definition or an initializer list) is called. *Correction: The `tree` class *doesn't* have an explicit constructor defined. The default constructor would be used, and the member `top` would not be automatically initialized to `NULL`. However, the `expression` function *does* set `t.top` to the root of the tree it builds.*
    *   `cout <<"Enter prefix Expression : ";`: Prompts the user to enter a prefix expression.
    *   `cin >> expr;`: Reads the user's input string into the `expr` array. `cin >>` stops reading at the first whitespace. This means prefix expressions with spaces between characters (like `+ * A B / C D`) would not be read correctly. It expects a single, space-free string like `+*AB/CD`.
    *   `cout << expr;`: Prints the expression that was read.
    *   `t.expression(expr);`: Calls the `expression` member function of the `t` object, passing the user-entered prefix expression. This function builds the expression tree and sets `t.top` to point to the root of the created tree.
    *   `t.non_rec_postorder(t.top);`: Calls the `non_rec_postorder` member function, passing the root of the tree (`t.top`). This performs the post-order traversal and prints the resulting postfix expression.
    *   `t.del(t.top);`: Calls the `del` member function, passing the root of the tree (`t.top`). This function recursively deletes all nodes in the tree, freeing the allocated memory.
    *   `// t.display(t.top);`: This line is commented out. If it were active, attempting to display the tree *after* it has been deleted would result in accessing freed memory, leading to undefined behavior (likely a crash).

**How the Prefix to Postfix Conversion Works (via the Tree):**

1.  **Building the Tree:** The `expression` function iterates through the prefix expression from right to left. When it encounters an operand, it creates a leaf node and pushes it onto a stack. When it encounters an operator, it pops the top two nodes from the stack (which represent the right and left subtrees of this operator, respectively), creates a new node for the operator, makes the popped nodes its children (right becomes left, left becomes right due to the right-to-left processing), and pushes the new operator node back onto the stack. This process correctly constructs the expression tree.
2.  **Post-order Traversal:** A post-order traversal of an expression tree visits the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the current node. For an expression tree, this order naturally yields the postfix expression. The `non_rec_postorder` function implements this using two stacks, effectively reversing the order of nodes pushed onto the second stack (`s2`) to achieve the post-order output.

**For Your Practical Exam:**

Be prepared to explain:

*   The difference between prefix, infix, and postfix expressions.
*   What an expression tree is and how it represents an expression.
*   How the `node` structure is defined for a binary tree.
*   The role of the `stack1` class and its methods (`push`, `pop`, `empty`).
*   The logic of the `expression` function, specifically why it processes the prefix string from right to left and how the stack is used to link children to operators.
*   The algorithm used in `non_rec_postorder` to perform a post-order traversal without recursion, explaining the purpose of the two stacks.
*   The logic of the `del` function and why it uses a post-order approach to safely delete the tree (deleting children before the parent).
*   The potential issue with using `free()` with memory allocated by `new`.
*   The limitation of `cin >> expr` for reading expressions with spaces.
*   The importance of deleting dynamically allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.

This in-depth explanation should provide you with a solid understanding of the code for your practical exam. Good luck!
